# javascript-fatigue
Some boilerplate snippets I usually use.
This is a totally biased lib / tool stack I currently enjoy to use, so it may
not fit your needs.

## Installation
Install this repo globally, it will expose certain bin scripts:

```
npm install git+https://github.com/ryyppy/javascript-fatigue -g 
```

## How to use

**jsfat-init**

```bash
$ mkdir my-new-project
$ cd my-new-project
$ jsfat-init
```

Will initialize and install all dependencies I need to start developing ES6
code. (babel, eslint, flow plugins, tape,... ). Also creates a basic directory
structure (src, test, interfaces, definitions).

Always make sure you are in the project root directory before usage!
